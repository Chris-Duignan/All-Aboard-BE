      '  Scythe  gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player\'s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are "Encounter" cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.   Scythe  uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.  Every part of  Scythe  has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times. ',

With new artwork by Chris Quilliams (Clash of Cultures, Merchants & Marauders), Pandemic will now have a more modern look, inside and outside the box. With two new characters (the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist) face the game in ways you never thought possible as brand-new, virulent challenges await you! \r\n In   Pandemic  , several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. \r\n The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are  Epidemic!  cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the \"normal\" spread of the infections. \r\n Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win! \r\n The 2013 edition of  Pandemic  includes two new characters—the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game. \r\n Artists: \r\n Joshua Cappel (graphics and illustration) \r\n Régis Moulun (cover painting) \r\n Chris Quilliams (2013 edition)    ",

Each month will bring new surprises, and your actions in each game will have repercussions on the next. Will you let cities fall to the diseases? Will your team be enough to keep the viruses at bay for a whole year? Craft your own unique Pandemic experience with Pandemic Legacy. \r\n  Pandemic Legacy  is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic   Pandemic  , in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. \r\n During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions. \r\n After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to. \r\n Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards. \r\n During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play. ",

      '   Brass: Birmingham   is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace\'s 2007 masterpiece,  Brass .  Birmingham  tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870. \r\n As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. \r\n Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game): \r\n 1)  Build  - Pay required resources and place an industry tile. 2)  Network  - Add a rail/canal link, expanding your network. 3)  Develop  - Increase the VP value of an industry. 4)  Sell  - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery. 5)  Loan  - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income. \r\n  Brass: Birmingham  also features a new sixth action: \r\n 6)  Scout  - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original  Brass .) \r\n The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles. \r\n  Birmingham  features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement. \r\n Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original  Brass  as well as in  Brass: Birmingham . \r\n  New "Sell" system  \r\n Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also "grease the wheels of industry" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer. \r\n  Birmingham  features three all-new industry types: \r\n  Brewery  - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods. \r\n  Manufactured goods  - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton. \r\n  Pottery  - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan. \r\n  Increased Coal and Iron Market size  - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it\'s not uncommon. \r\n  Brass: Birmingham  is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. ',

      " The women and men of your expedition build the first two settlements. Fortunately, the land is rich in natural resources. You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan? Barter trade dominates the scene. Some resources you have in abundance, other resources are scarce. Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too. \r\n To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea. \r\n Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements. \r\n And so it begins. I roll two dice. An “11”! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool. \r\n We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents. \r\n Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points. If you expand cleverly, you may be the first player to reach 10 victory points and thus win the game! ",

In the past, it was a way to make use of leftover pieces of cloth to create clothing and quilts. Today, patchwork is a form of art, in which the designers use precious fabrics to create beautiful textiles. The use of uneven pieces of fabric in particular can result in real masterpieces and is therefore being practiced by a large number of textile artists.  To create a beautiful quilt, however, requires effort and time, but the available patches just do not want to fit together.

      " In Race for the Galaxy from Rio Grande Games, players build galactic civilizations using game cards that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Each round consists of one or more of five possible phases. In each round, each player secretly and simultaneously chooses one of seven different action cards and then reveals it. Only the selected phases occur. For these phases, every player performs the phasea€s action, while the selecting player(s) also get a bonus for that phase. For example, if at least one player chooses the Develop action, then the Develop phase will occur, otherwise it is skipped. In it, each player may simultaneously select a development from his hand of cards to build. After revealing the cards, each player adds his development to his tableau of cards on the table and then discards cards from his hand equal to its cost. Each player who chose Develop discards one card fewer as his bonus. Explore allows a player to draw cards and select which of them to add to his hand. Settle allows a player to place a world in his tableau. Some worlds produce goods, represented by face down cards, when Produce is selected. These goods can be discarded for victory points or sold to add cards to the player's hand by selecting Consume. With cards, players can settle new worlds and build more developments, gaining both victory points and card powers that provide advantages in certain phases. The player who best manages his cards, phase and bonus selections, and card powers to build the greatest space empire, wins. The winner is the player with the most victory points. ",

Players are given a sandbox in which to play as gods, moving their workers around the board to build up a beautiful, multi-tiered city. Do you have what it takes to outsmart your opponents? Find out, in  Santorini ! \r\n \r\n \r\n   Santorini   is a re-imagining of the purely abstract 2004 edition. Since its original inception over 30 years ago, Santorini has been continually developed, enhanced and refined by designer Gordon Hamilton. \r\n Santorini is an accessible strategy game, simple enough for an elementary school classroom while aiming to provide gameplay depth and content for hardcore gamers to explore, The rules are simple. Each turn consists of 2 steps: \r\n  1. Move  - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels. \r\n  2. Build  - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved. When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play. \r\n  Winning the game  - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win. \r\n  Variable player powers  - Santorini features variable player powers layered over an otherwise abstract game, with 40 thematic god and hero powers that fundamentally change the way the game is played. \r\n \r\n \r\n   Turns in  Santorini  are made up of two simple step: Move and Build. Move around the board and build a building in a spot adjacent to one of your workers. The first player to move their worker from a second level building to a third level building wins the game! Though, there are a few things that add a wrinkle to the basic formula.  Invoke the Power of the gods! Each player will have access to a god power which lets them do things a little differently than normal. Be it changing the rules for how you can build or move, changing how you interact with other players, or providing you with an alternate victory condition, the 30 different god powers are sure to make every game of  Santorini  different and exciting! \r\n ",

The trail will be tough, and countless hazards await you. Can you make it to the end of your journey and turn a tidy profit? Find out in Great Western Trail!   Simple Mechanics, Complex Decisions  Turns in Great Western Trail are broken into three simple phases that will carry you through the entire game. These simple phases belie a web of deep and complex decisions players will face as they make their way down the trail. The mechanics are simple, but mastering the trail is where the fun lies.   Make Your Move!  A turn starts by moving your cattleman down the trail. The number of spaces a player is allowed to move is dictated by their player board, and there are hazards a plenty all along the trail. Wherever you end up, the next phase is ...   Take Action!  When a player ends their movement, they perform the action listed on the space they ended on. Depending on where you land, you will have different options available to you. Neutral locations or buildings you own will allow you to perform a special action specific to that location or a single auxiliary action. On locations owned by other players, hazard tiles, or teepee tiles, your only option is to use an auxiliary action. Last, there's Kansas City!   Kansas City or Bust!  Landing on Kansas City sets off a series of subphases that must be resolved in order: Three Foresight phases, the Income Phase, and the Delivery Phase. The Foresight subphases give players a choice between two tiles to add to the board (hazard, teepee, or worker). These tiles will affect future trips down the trail, so choose wisely. Earn income from your journey down the trail by revealing and discarding your hand. Finally, choose a city to deliver your cattle to. This leg of your journey is over. Now it's time to do it all again!   Draw!  Draw up to your hand limit and your turn is over! Time to start planning your next move and figure out the choices you'll face in the coming turns. \r\n ",

It's the Vikings' last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin's side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfil quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarok, the ultimate inescapable doom. Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These \"Gods' Gifts\" grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner. Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents' strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponents' actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death! ",

      ' Prospector, captain, mayor, trader, settler, craftsman, or builder? Which roles will you play in the new world? Will you own the most prosperous plantations? Will you build the most valuable buildings? You have but one goal: achieve the greatest prosperity and highest respect! This is shown by the player who earns the most victory points. He will win the game! \r\n \r\n \r\n In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings. \r\n Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons. \r\n The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists. \r\n During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as "Trader" or "Builder"). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the "Builder" role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game. \r\n Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a "governor" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action. \r\n Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned "large buildings." Each player\'s accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game. \r\n In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I – New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II – The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n 0 Links \r\n \r\n ',

You need followers and their abilities to expand your dominance by putting them to work as traders, builders, and scientists. Knights expand your scope of action and secure your mercantile expeditions. Craftsmen build trading stations and tools to facilitate work. Scholars make progress in science, and last but not least it cannot hurt to get active in monasteries since with monks on your side you are much less likely to fall prey to fate. \r\n In   Orléans  , you will always want to take more actions than possible, and there are many paths to victory. The challenge is to combine all elements as best as possible with regard to your strategy. \r\n \r\n\r\n ",

      " Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland. At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe. Players represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky! The game comes with nine different clans, a modular board with 16 configurations, nine port bonuses and nine round scoring tiles. ",

Even while dominating opponents, however, you have to keep in mind that your race's civilization is doomed as well, thanks to the passing of time and attacking of neighbors, so be ready to cast aside one tribe while taking the reins of another in order to keep dominating the world.  Small World is for 2-5 players and contains two double-sided gameboards, with one side being used for each of the different number of possible players. The 14 fantasy races come with matching banners and tokens, and the game also includes 20 special power badges to further customize the races along with mountains, troll lairs, fortresses, holes-in-the-ground, victory coins. and other items.

      " Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games, removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original editionwhile retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.  The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark preexisting routes between cities for connection, and then vie against other players to purchase the power plants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you?re potentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely by purchasing at all.   Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants (except for the highly valuable renewable energy wind/solar plants), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes. \r\n  Power Grid: Recharged Edition  will replace Power Grid. Small but meaningful improvements have been made to the game including updated rules to improve game play, an updated player order tracker, new reference cards, and a discount token to enhance power plant auctions. Power Grid: Recharged Edition will be compatible with all previous Power Grid expansions. ",

You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult. No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries. \r\n Meanwhile, each of your adventures in Arkham Horror: The Card Game carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the ancient ones straining against the barriers to our world… the basic mode of play in Arkham Horror: The Card Game is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. \r\n All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand. And your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you. ",

And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats? \r\n Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over. Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it's important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do. ",

      " \r\n Centuries ago, the spice trade was the most important market in the world. It established and destroyed empires, compelled men to explore the far corners of the earth, and led to the discovery of new worlds. At that time, the value of spices even rivaled that of gold! In the old days, they carried a sense of mystery and allure. Spice merchants would weave fantastic tales of danger to reach these spices in hopes of selling their wares at higher prices. In later centuries, the demand on spices became so great, that those who controlled the spices generated immense wealth and renown. It is at this time, you find yourself leading your caravan across the eastern lands to the Mediterranean Sea in search of wealth and fortune. As a caravan leader, your journey begins on the Spice Road. This is Century: Spice Road!  In  Century: Spice Road , players aim to collect and trade spices in order to acquire point cards and coins that are worth points at the end of the game. Players play cards from their hands to acquire spices for their caravan and trade those spices in for wealth and power (point cards and money), or to purchase new merchant cards to more efficiently acquire rare and valuable spices. Players take one action a turn until someone has acquired their fifth (or sixth in 2-3 player game) point card, players will finish out the current round of play and the person with the most points wins!   Play or Acquire Cards  At the start of the game, each player is given two merchant cards to start with and some preliminary spices. On their turn, each player may choose, as their action for the turn, to play a card from their hand, or spend spices to acquire a new merchant card from the row and place it in their hand. Merchant cards allow players to acquire new spices, exchange spices they currently have for different ones, or upgrade a spice to one worth more. Building up a good spice trading engine of merchant cards is an important part of succeeding on the Spice Road, so look out for powerful play sequences when taking new cards!   Rest  Once they've played all the cards from their hands, players must use their turn action to rest and return their cards to their hand. Now they'll be able to play their cards again on future turns, building up their caravan and further developing their hand of merchant cards to start acquiring point cards.   Claim Point Cards  The way to win in Century: Spice Road is to have the most points at the end of the game. Players get points when they acquire Point Cards and Coins by trading in their spices. Each point card in the row will have a different cost and overall point value listed on it, and the spice cost must be paid to acquire that card. If the two leftmost cards in the row are acquired, whoever acquired one of those point cards can take a coin from the pile above it. Silver coins are worth 1 point at the end of the game and gold coins are worth 3 points! Once a player has bought their fifth point card, the round of play finishes and a winner is crowned! \r\n ",

      '   Keyflower   is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a "home" tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player\'s own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players\' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned. \r\n In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game. \r\n  Keyflower  presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers. \r\n  Keyflower , a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the "Key" series from R&D Games set in the medieval "Key" land.

      " Isle of Skye, one of the most beautiful places in the world: Soft sand beaches, gently sloping hills, impressive mountains: the landscape of Isle of Skye is breathtaking and fascinates everyone.  In this tile-laying game 2 to 5 players are the chieftains of 5 famous clans. The players try to build their little kingdoms to score as many points as possible. But in each game only 4 of the 16 scoring cards will be scored. Each game is different and leads to different tactics and strategies.  To have enough money is useful in all games: In each turn the players can buy a tile from another player. The seller determines the price, but to do it wisely is the most interesting part of this game: A high price will lead to wealth, if someone buys this tile, but if there's no buyer, the seller will lose the money spend on this tile.  And in the end the player with the best kingdom will become the sovereign of the island, not the richest player!  Isle of Skye is a gateway game for the whole family. With a playing time around 45 minutes , a huge variability and easy rules it's a perfect game for all players. The awesome illustrations by Klemens Franz brings all the athmosphere of the scottish island on your table. ",

      " Corporation Incorporated is an interplanetary construction firm that builds sewer systems and low-income housing on the less-developed planets of the Galaxy. For years, Corp Inc. Has tottered on the brink of bankruptcy: transporting building materials to the edge of the Galaxy, where the need for their services is greatest, is a risky business.  The company was saved by a few visionaries on the board of directors. Instead of shipping materials to the Periphery, they reasoned, why not build the materials into spacecraft and let them ship themselves? Furthermore, why hire pilots if there are nut-cases who will do it for free?  That's where you come in. Just sign the contract, and you gain unrestricted access to a Corp Inc. Warehouse. Build your own space ship from the available prefabricated components, and fly it to the Periphery. Of course, you may have to eat a loss, but any profits you make along the way are yours to keep, and Corporation Incorporated will pay you a bonus for quick delivery.  It's possible that you will end up with an insurmountable debt and finish your days panhandling on the streets of Deneb III, but if Lady Luck should smile upon you, you just might find yourself among the 10 billion richest people in the Galaxy!

      " \r\n  A Grand Voyage!  The year is 1275, and Marco Polo has finally reached the court of Kublai Khan after four years of grueling travel over the Silk Road. Together with his father, Marco hoped to establish news trade routes to bring riches from the East back to Europe, and in  The Voyages of Marco Polo , you will attempt to do the same. \r\n Players will attempt to recreate Marco Polo's famous journey over the Silk Road, playing as Marco and his father or one of their many associates from their travels, each with their own unique power. Collect points by completing contracts, visiting new cities, and reaching your final destination of Beijing and the court of Kublai Khan. Do you have what it takes to prosper? Find out in  The Voyages of Marco Polo !   Preparing to Set Out   The Voyages of Marco Polo  is a Dice Placement game. At the beginning of each Round, players will roll their dice and then take turns placing those dice in space on the board for various effects. Some spaces have the same effect no matter the number on the die placed there, but some spaces have different effects depending on their result of the roll. Some spaces even require you commit multiple dice and take the action based on the lowest number rolled among the dice placed there. \r\n Placing dice is how players move their merchants down the trade routes and toward Beijing, gather money to pay for goods and their travels, acquire resources to fulfill their contracts. And, spaces are limited! Once another player has filled a space, you'll need to spend more resources in order to take the same action, potentially setting your plan back or forcing you to readjust. Plan well and choose your actions wisely, and you may just find yourself ahead of the pack.   Multiple Strategies  There are many decisions to be made from round to round, and there are multiple avenues to victory in any given game. The roads you take to victory can change from game to game thanks to the special power of your character and the unique city bonuses used for each.   Unique Powers   Each character has their own unique ability that can hugely impact your strategy as the game progresses. Raschid ad-Din allows you to choose the value of your dice rather than rolling them. Niccolo and Marco Polo give you an additional figure to move across the map and a camel at the beginning of every round. Take advantage of your special skills and leave your opponents in the dust!   Different City Cards Every Game!   With 31 different city cards, every voyage will be unique. Plan your route carefully as you seek to take advantage of the bonuses each city has to offer. At the beginning of each game, the city bonus cards will be drawn randomly from the deck, providing new strategic opportunities and incredible replayability. \r\n ",

      "  Tiny Epic Galaxies  is driven by an exciting dice-rolling mechanic that rewards thoughtful programming of the results. Players control a home planet and a series of space ships within their own personal galaxy. As players upgrade their galaxies they gain access to more ships and more dice.  Each turn, a player will roll a set of dice, how many dice are rolled is determined by the level of that player's galaxy. Each side of the die (6 sided) represents a different type of action: Movement, Colony Action, Harvest from Culture Planets, Harvest from Energy Planets, Improve an Economic Influence, Improve a Diplomatic Influence.  After the roll, the player then sorts the results of the roll (one selective re-roll is allowed) and organizes the dice in a desired activation order. Each die, in order, is then resolved and the results are immediate! This gets very exciting, as it allows the player to pull-off unseen combos and surprise other players. But don't fret! Other players have the option to copy other player's actions... at a cost!  In addition to upgrading galaxies, effective resource management provides luck-mitigating options that can sway the game in a calculated player's favor.  As players expand their galaxy by colonizing other planets through economic and diplomatic influence, they gain victory points AND the special powers brought in by those planets!  You are the ruler of your galaxy and there are no limits to your expansion! ",

      "  Mecatol Rex. The center of the known galaxy and seat of the former Lazax Empire. Scarred by the flames of betrayal, Rex is a specter of a fallen empire and of ages long forgotten, yet it remains an object of reverence-and desire-in a galaxy of conflict and uncertainty.  Once, the great city that spanned its surface was the pinnacle of civilization. Today, Mecatol City is naught but a blasted shell of its former glory, a grim respite in the toxic Sea of Desolation that covers the majority of the planet.  Even so, its parabolic history of decadence and destruction does little to deter those who would seek to harness its power. The Winaaran custodians who dwell within the remnants of the city maintain what is left of the former capital, waiting for one of the Great Races to step forward and take up the mantle of the former Emperors.  But who among the races of the galaxy could fill the void left by the Lazax? To lay claim to the throne is a destiny sought by many, yet the shadows of the past serve as a grim warning to those who would follow in their footsteps...     \r\n   Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition   is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy. \r\n No two games of  Twilight Imperium  are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate. \r\n A round of  Twilight Imperium  begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways. \r\n After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points. ",

      ' In  Dinosaur Island  players will compete to create the world\'s greatest Dinosaur theme park. You\'ll need to acquire DNA, research the DNA sequences to bring different species of dinosaurs back from extinction, combine your DNA to create these beastly creatures.  Of course, it\'s 2017 and guests are easily bored. So, you should probably build some roller coasters and shops to keep your guests entertained. Oh, and maybe invest in some security, because if you don\'t your dinosaurs may escape and eat your guests, and who wants to deal with regulators coming in and telling you your park is a "death trap".  The game uses 10 full-color dice to create the pool of available DNA at the beginning of the round, and features really unique artwork inspired by early 90s graphic design to catch your eye and 3d renderings for the rides. The game contains Dino-meeples, double thick cardboard with cut outs to keep tracking cubes from sliding when the table is bumped, and two unique mechanisms that we are really fond of.  The game-length is variable from 60 minutes to 2.5 hours regardless of player count simply by adjusting the number of "end-game" cards used. The game also features "plot twist" cards that change certain game rules each time you play for endless replay-ability. No two games will ever be the same!  The game is a mid-weight strategic worker-placement game with strong thematic integration with the mechanics. We\'ve found the games complexity to be a bit lighter while maintaining tense decisions. This was accomplished by breaking various actions into 4 unique phases so that order of operation is less critical to your success allowing new players to grasp the flow of the game quicker. ',

The Swan allows you to lead the next trick even if you lose this one. The Fox lets you switch a card in your hand with the decree card setting the trump suit. The Woodcutter lets you swap a card in your hand with one of the extra cards. The Treasure will give the winner of a trick a free point for each 7 in the trick. The Witch will act as the trump suit if it's the only witch in the trick.

First, the player with the longest continuous path of trains receives a ten point bonus. Second, each player scores bonus points for connecting the cities on one or more tickets with two distinct routes.

Communicating in coded messages, they sneak past enemy assassins in an attempt to complete their mission before time runs out. \r\n  Codenames: Duet  is a cooperative word game for two or more players. A key card gives you 9 words to give clues and 3 words your partner must avoid. A clue is only one word, but it can point to multiple words that you want your partner to guess. Your partner also gives you clues for the words you need to find. If you both find all the words before you run out of turns, you both win! \r\n With a new way to play, 400 new words that work with the original  Codenames , and 100 new challenges,  Codenames: Duet  is sure to push your mind to the limit!   Go Undercover!  In  Codenames: Duet , players must work together to uncover all the secret agents on both sides of the key card before they run out of turns. You'll need to be quick-witted, because these challenges will put your deductive skills to the test!    It Takes Two to Tango!   You and a partner will pick a key card and set up the grid of words. You'll take turns, going back and forth, giving each other clues to guess as many words as possible before passing to the other player. On their turn, a player gives a word and a number as their clue and the other player makes guesses as to which words hide a hidden operative. Correct guesses are covered in a green agent card, if a player guesses a word that is black on your key card, the game is over and you lose. If a guessed word is tan on the key card, that is an innocent bystander and the turn ends with you taking a token from the time bank and placing it on the guessed word. If the two players can guess all 15 hidden operatives before running out of turn tokens, they win the game!   Sudden Death   If players run out of time, they enter sudden death, relying on previous clues to guess where the remaining operative are hiding. If a word is guessed correctly, the guessing continues, but if a bystander or assassin is uncovered, the game is over and the players lose.   More Ways to Play!   Codenames: Duet  is designed for two players, but it can be played with a group. Players will split up into two teams and play the game as normal, any member of a team able to give the clue. Teams may privately discuss their clues to come up with the perfect one! \r\n Players may also embark on a campaign using the Mission Map pad. Each completed game will let you move on to new and more challenging missions that change the number of turn counters and bystander tokens. Some missions reduce the number of turns you have while other leave less room for error. After completing these challenging missions, you can consider yourselves Codewords masters! \r\n ",

      " Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it's too late. Secret Hitler introduces new mechanics to the hidden-identity game genre. The first is the element of randomness. When laws are passed, the President draws three policies, passes two to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor enacts one. Only the enacted policy is revealed, so players have to rely on the President and Chancellor's word to know what got discarded. The deck has a known initial composition (11 Fascist policies, 6 Liberal policies), and players can roughly track deck contents based on what the President and Chancellor report, though someone might have lied about what was discarded. That means players can form reasonable expectations and plan around probability, but they can also manipulate future probabilities and expectations in a way that benefits their team. The second new mechanic is the \"Hitler\" identity: If Hitler is elected as Chancellor after the third fascist policy has already been enacted, the game ends immediately and the fascists win. This means Hitler will spend most of the game playing as a liberal to gain players' trust. Once the third fascist policy is enacted, anyone who has helped the group becomes immediately suspect; if the liberals make a wrong move at this point, they lose immediately. This creates incredible moments of tension and relief in the game. ",

      " The War of the Ring has begun! The War of the Ring is a grand strategy board game that allows its players to immerse themselves in the world of J.R.R Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and experience its epic action, dramatic conflict, and memorable characters.  As the Free Peoples player you command the proud hosts of the most important kingdoms of the Third Age. From the horse-lords of Rohan to the soldiers of Gondor and the Elven lords of Rivendell, you lead the defense of the last free realms of Middle-earth.  Face the evil minions of Sauron on the field of battle in a desperate attempt to delay their onslaught, while you lead the Fellowship of the Ring in the Quest for Mount Doom.  As the Shadow player you lead the hordes of the Dark Lord and his most powerful minions as they try to bring darkness to Middle-earth. Legions of Orcs, Trolls, Wolfriders, and the dreadful Ringwraiths await your command. Hunt the Ring-bearer and bring the precious Ring to his Master, or crush your enemies with your unstoppable armies.  This is your chance to forge the destiny of an age! \r\n \r\n \r\n In   War of the Ring  , one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not. \r\n The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest. \r\n Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track). \r\n Action Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle. \r\n \r\n ",

      " Tigris & Euphrates is an award-winning tile placement game of rival dynasties designed by Reiner Knizia and set in ancient Mesopotamia at the time of the first cities. Two to four players take on the roles of rulers building civilizations, competing for land, and striving to strike a balance between commerce, agriculture, housing, and religion.  Advance your civilization, grow your dynasty, and accumulate victory points by strategically placing tiles, leaders, and even monuments on the board. As civilizations grow, wars may erupt over the region's limited land and resources, or another ruler may incite rebellion among your people, forcing you to fight for your territory. The ruler who has the greatest amount of victory points in the weakest aspect of their civilization wins! ",

The team has only seconds to assess the situation and devise a plan of attack - then you spring into action like the trained professionals that you are.

You are the brave men and women of fire rescue, people are depending on you. This is what you do every day.   \r\n   Flash Point: Fire Rescue   is a cooperative game of fire rescue. \r\n There are two versions of game play in Flash Point, a basic game and expert game. In both variants, players are attempting to rescue 7 of 10 victims from a raging building fire. As the players attempt to rescue the victims, the fire spreads to other parts of the building, causing structural damage and possibly blocking off pathways through the building. Each turn a player may spend action points to try to extinguish fires, move through the building, move victims out of the building or perform various special actions such as moving emergency vehicles. If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose. Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim. \r\n The expert variant included in the game adds thematic elements such as flash over, combustible materials, random setup, and variations on game difficulty from novice to heroic. The game includes a double sided board with two different building plans and several expansion maps are available. ",

      " \r\n \r\n On the 11th of July, 1899 at 10 a.m., the Union Pacific Express has left Folsom, New Mexico, with 47 passengers on board. After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top? \r\n In   Colt Express  , you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases: \r\n \r\n  Phase 1: Schemin'  Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck. \r\n  Phase 2: Stealin'  The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights! \r\n \r\n The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play. \r\n Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a \"steal\" card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items — but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car. \r\n Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground. \r\n You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too. \r\n At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins! \r\n \r\n \r\n   Nominated for the 2015 Spiel des Jahres award.

      " A game of Eclipse places you in control of vast interstellar civilizations, competing for success. You will explore new star systems, research technologies and build spaceships to wage war with. There are many potential paths to victory, so you need to plan your strategy according to the strengths and weaknesses of your species while paying attention to the other civilizations' endeavors.   In the core of Eclipse, there are innovative resource management and action selection mechanisms. Even though you explore space and take over new sectors on the common game board, all the production and resource management is done conveniently on your own player board. The upkeep cost of your civilization rises rapidly as you take more actions and the area you control increases. This creates an interesting balancing problem and restrains the exponential growth of the civilizations.  Eclipse is an epic empire building game that even with full player count can be played under three hours. Euro-type game mechanisms offer a smooth gameplay and minimize the downtime. Nevertheless, Eclipse has a lot of details and theme woven seamlessly into the game. For example, you may design your own starships: each player has four ship types that they can build and design as they will. The technology tree also has a new, non-linear system.  Eclipse has seven different species for you to choose from. Each player can either play as Terrans (ie. humans) or one of the unique alien species. Each species has different characteristics and abilities. The modular board and the dynamic technology tree ensure that each session of Eclipse is unique! ",

Now is the time for a clever leader to unite them into a powerful alliance, skillfully using the unique talents of each tribe to control the Kingdoms. \r\nDo you have the wit and the wisdom to become the next Lord of  Ethnos  and usher in a Golden Age? Up to six players can evoke the assistance of the Tribes of  Ethnos  to earn themselves enough glory to be named the Lord of  Ethnos . Find out if you're up to the task!   The Tribes of  Ethnos    There are twelve distinct tribes that inhabit the land of  Ethnos , and each has their own unique ability that will help you take control of the Kingdoms and gain glory for yourself. Call on the Centaurs when swift and decisive actions must be taken! Overwhelm your opponents with sheer numbers by relying on the Halflings! The Dwarves, Elves, Giants, Merfolk, Minotaurs, Orcs, Skeletons, Trolls, Wingfolk, and Wizards are all at your disposal! Use the special abilities of each tribe to your advantage to take control of territories and gain yourself some extra glory along the way. Work with what you're given to spread your influence and unite the tribes of  Ethnos  to be crowned the victor!   Beginning a New Age  A game of  Ethnos  is divided into three Ages in which players will try to gain as much glory as possible. On their turn, players will choose to Recruit an Ally (from either the deck or the face up options on the table) or Play a Band of Allies. Recruiting allies to your cause is necessary if you want to gain any influence in the Six Kingdoms, which you do by playing Bands.   Band Together   When you play a Band of Allies from your hand (from 1 to 10 cards), each ally within the band must belong to the same Tribe or the same Kingdom (color). Each band has a leader which will determine the ability you get to resolve when playing the band. If the band is large enough, you may place one of your control markers in that kingdom that matches the color of your leader card. You then use your leader card's ability. Then you must discard the cards remaining in your hand face up for other players to recruit from. These bands will be important for scoring at the end of the round, so leave them in front of you.   Control the Kingdoms   As you gain more influence in a Kingdom, the bigger your bands must be to place your control markers there. Each Kingdom will reward players with an amount of glory at the end of an Age according to who has the most influence in each Kingdom. As Ages pass, the players with the second-most and third-most influence in each Kingdom will also gain glory.    A New Age Dawns   The game will play out over three Ages, and the heralding of a new Age is brought on by the arrival of three dragons. Once the third dragon has been drawn from the deck, the Age ends and scoring for that Age begins. Control markers persist between Ages, representing the influence gained in Ages past. Once this has happened three times, the game is over and final scores can be tallied! ",

The Paths of other players cross and connect, so the choices you make affect all the journeys across the board. Stay on the right Path-your journey begins here. \r\n The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.

Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch. The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round. The game lasts for three "epochs" (rounds). ',

At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl. Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you - and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions. ",

Each player will assume the role of one of six major Animal groups-Mammal, Reptile, Bird, Amphibian, Arachnid or Insect.

      " Preserved in its original form first published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2002, fans will find the same fantastic art from Jean-Louis Mourier and beloved gameplay that inspired the revised edition of the new and expanded Citadels.   In Citadels Classic, the same inspired and simple gameplay remains, with players attempting to build a fantastical medieval city by constructing different districts. Each round, starting with whoever holds the crown, players will pass around a hand of characters equal to one plus the number of players, secretly choosing one character to employ, taking advantage of their special ability. Among the eight characters you might find, each boasts a different special ability: the Thief can steal all the gold from another player, the King grants gold for each Noble district you have constructed and receives the crown for the next round, and the Architect allows a player to build several districts that turn.   After all players have chosen their character, they are revealed in the order determined by their rank, which is the number printed in the upper lefthand corner of their card. For example, if a player chose the Assassin with its rank of 1, they would resolve their turn first. The next to follow is the Thief with its rank of 2, then the Magician at 3, and so on, skipping characters that were not employed this round, and until all players have resolved their actions.  When you do resolve your turn, you will choose to either take two gold coins from the bank or draw new district cards. Then, if you can afford to pay its cost, you may construct a single district from you hand. You may also resolve your character abilities as they apply during your turn, whether it be naming a character to kill with the Assassin or gaining extra gold with the Trader. Play continues until all players have resolved their actions, then the character cards are reshuffled and a new round begins.  The first player to construct seven districts triggers the endgame, allowing the round to finish and all other players to take their final actions. Each district is worth its cost in victory points, with bonus points awarded for those who construct all seven of their districts and those who have at least one type of each district (noble, religious, trade, military, and unique). Whoever has the most victory points has built the most fabulous city and is crowned winner! ",

To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner. \r\n In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply). \r\n A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round. \r\n The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king. ",

      " Walk a mile in the shoes of a spy! Or was it a kilometer in clogs?  SPYFALL is an easy-to-learn card game of bluffing, probing questions, clever answers, and suspicion. At the start of each round, players receive a secret card letting them know where they are - a casino, space station, pirate ship, circus, (30 unique locations!) - except that one player receives the SPY card instead of the location. The Spy doesn't know where he is, but wins the round if he can figure it out before he blows his cover!  Players then start asking each other questions during the intense 8-minute rounds. Non-Spy players want to ask questions and give answers that prove to the other players that they know where they are. But watch out! If your questions and answers are too specific, the Spy will easily guess the location and win, so you need to practice a bit of subtlety. But if your questions and answers are too generic, you might be accused of being the Spy. The Spy will also sometimes be asked questions (just like any other player would) and have to come up with questions of his own, without knowing anything about where he is! If you listened carefully to the other players, you'll be able to come up with a plausible question or answer... hopefully.  Once per round, each player may accuse another player of being the Spy. If all players agree, the game ends and that player's secret card is flipped up. If the Spy is captured, each of the Non-Spy players win the round. If a Non-Spy is revealed, the Spy wins. Finally, if the Spy figures out where he is, he can reveal his card and make a guess. If he's right, he wins the round. If not, the Non-Spy players win.  The game is played over a series of rounds and points are awarded each round. A complete game is typically five rounds and the cards are randomly dealt each round. You could even be the Spy two rounds in a row! After the last round, the player with the most points is the winner. ",

Nine different kinds of terrain are on the variable game board, including locations and castles. During his turn, a player plays his terrain card and builds three settlements on three hexes of this kind. If possible, a new settlement must be built next to one of that player's existing settlements. When building next to a location, the player may seize an extra action tile that he may use from his next turn on. These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.   By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.  Each game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards (3 of 10), special actions (4 of 8), and terrain sectors to build the map (4 of 8), ensuring you won't play the same game twice! ",

      " Lisboa is a game about the reconstruction of the great Portuguese capital city after a series of terrible catastrophes. On November 1, 1755, Lisboa suffered an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 8.5-9.0, followed by a devastating tsunami and 3 days of raging fires. The city was almost totally destroyed.  Lisboa is thus played, in part, on a representational map of the city. During the planning of the downtown re-building project, the type of businesses permitted in each street was pre-determined. The clockmakers and goldsmiths had their street; as did the bookstores and libraries; the tailors and silk vendors; and the toolmakers as well. This all comes into play on the Lisboa gameboard.   Players represent the nobility of Lisboa who will use their influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city.   In rebuilding the city, players will make use of the Royal Builder, who works with the architects to build Lisboa anew, while the Marquis will provide aid in the development of commerce. The King will provide players with political help in re-opening the beautiful new city. But the true reason you are rebuilding the city is not for greatness, or even fame or fortune. As a nobleman or noblewoman of Lisboa, your primary motivation is the acquisition of Wigs--a most important trading commodity of the Era, and the means of scoring points in the game. ",

By spending wild cards, players gain the ability to build routes three trains long or longer, in addition to being able to build ferries across water and build train routes in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Players can also buy bonus cards that allow them to score extra points for taking certain actions during play. Despite the name, the map covers both the UK and the Republic of Ireland, that is, the islands of Great Britain and Ireland. \r\n Although officially an expansion for Ticket to Ride or Ticket to Ride: Europe, this could be used for Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries.

      "   The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game   is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next. \r\n  The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game  is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be successful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players. \r\n Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire. \r\n The scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from the books. Saga-expansions will form the Campaign Mode so that you can play all the saga quests that deal with the trilogy (+ Hobbit) together in one marathon campaign. ",

Over six rounds, they try to transport their stone blocks to end up in the most valuable positions at five construction sites: pyramid, obelisk, chamber tomb, temple, and market. But a player can only choose one of three actions in a turn: excavate a new stone block from the quarry, load a block onto a ship, or move a ship to a construction site. From there, the massive stone blocks must be unloaded in order from bow to stern and placed on the sites in preset sequences. Depending on where the blocks end up, players earn different point values either immediately or at the end of the game.  In each turn, you must weigh your options for getting your own stones into place and thwarting your opponents' placement plans. You must get your blocks to the right places, in the right order, at the right time to be the greatest architect. ",

Grab a piece of it by yourself! \r\n The game is played in turns using different phases: \r\n \r\n Players decide which OMDE goals will be part of the game, how the new settlers from earth will be distributed through the different colonies, and which community buildings and materials Earth needs to authorize and provide. \r\n Players will have available to everyone a limited set of actions they can take in their turn and the raw materials sent from Earth. \r\n In turn order, players take one action, but they need to plan carefully; builds consume power and a second building may not be placed before a generator is upgraded. \r\n Last, all the Colony parameters are adjusted. \r\n \r\n Actions may be: to build buildings, rovers or ships; to produce; to buy or sell resources; to explore; and to research. \r\n Actions take the form of worker placement, cards in buildings, scientists tokens, or tech tiles. \r\n All actions have an energy cost, so upgrading the generators and the existing power grid is very important. At the same time, most of the buildings need Ore to be built, plus energy, people, and O₂ to run. Settlers need food, water, and shelter to be able to survive. \r\n Food, water, and O₂ needs to be stored. If you can’t store enough resources, the population will not grow. ",

One player takes control of the legendary Count Dracula as he stealthily crosses Victorian-era Europe, spreading his diabolical vampirism everywhere he goes. Up to four other players govern Mina Harker and her determined companions as they try to locate and destroy the fiendish Count before he plunges Europe into horrific darkness. But in this heated game of cat and mouse, the hunted prey may also be preying on his hunters. Any day's travel might bring the hunters to Dracula's location. On any night the Count may attack. \r\n This edition features all-new art and graphic design crafted to complement the game's intuitive, thematic mechanics. Rounds are now broken into day and night: hunters take actions during both, but Dracula can only act at night. Combat is now more streamlined and decisive, and new rumor tokens allow Dracula to mislead hunters and extend the terrible reach of his influence. Count Dracula triumphs if he advances his influence track to thirteen; if the hunters can defeat him before then, they save the continent of Europe and win the game. \r\n  Fourth edition:  \r\n The fourth edition of  Fury of Dracula  contains pre-painted miniatures instead of unpainted figures.

      ' On November 30, 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from Napoleon. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson decided to send two explorers - Meriwether Lewis and William Clark - to discover this huge terra incognita. Lewis & Clark is a board game in which the players manage an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance.   Lewis & Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new "hand building" mechanism fits strongly the historical background. Since the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players\' positions are crucial. ',

Many of the participating cities became very fabulously wealthy and powerful, and proudly proclaimed themselves \"Hansa cities.\" Players compete for wealth and prestige as merchants in the Hanseatic League. Players may set up a network of branch offices in as many cities as possible in an effort to expand their base of power, but they must also develop their talents and trading skills if they wish to be the best and take down the opposition.  Developing trading skills allows players to become more efficient in their activities. They may gain additional actions, higher income, new privileges, and improved prestige point return. Developing a preferred profile will create an advantageous position that will be paramount in developing a winning strategy against the other players.  Hansa Teutonica is very open to players' preferred strategies, and gives players the freedom they need to maneuver their way to the top. Clever use of traders, perpetual observation of opponents' activities, continuous improvement of skills, and the well-timed use of prestigous activities are key to becoming the most successful merchant in the history of the Hanse.

At the end of the initial setup, shuffle the Ragnarök tokens that are not on the board or on the Age Track and draw two of them. Look at the names of the two provinces listed on the tokens and place one god figure in each of them (these Ragnarök tokens are then put aside). \r\n Each god's ability is always in effect, changing the rules of the province they're in. The rest of the provinces are not affected. After a player attempts to pillage a province containing a god figure, whether he succeeds in the pillaging or not, he must then move the god to a different unpillaged province that does not contain a god figure. So the two gods can never occupy the same province, and they never go to a pillaged or destroyed province. \r\n At the beginning of the 2nd and 3rd Ages, the two gods are again placed in random provinces, determined by drawing 2 unused Ragnarök tokens. \r\n The combination of the two gods used in each game creates a unique texture to that session. They affect draft choices and influence the flow of the battles. Will your try to benefit from a god's power again and again by moving him where you want and always pillaging his province? Or will you do your best to neutralize him by pillaging around his province? Perhaps you'll want to attempt a hopeless pillage on his province just to move him onto another province where he will hinder another player's plans. They add a whole new layer to the game, without adding hardly any complexity to the rules. \r\n The miniatures each come with a tarot-sized God card. ",

      " Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small is a new take on Uwe Rosenberg's Agricola designed for exactly two players and focused only on the animal husbandry aspect of that game. So long plows and veggies! \r\n In Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, you become an animal breeder of horses, cows, sheep and pigs and try to make the most of your pastures. Players start with a 3x2 game board that can be expanded during play to give more room for players to grow and animals to run free. Sixteen possible actions are available for players to take, with each player taking three actions total in each of the eight rounds. \r\n The player who amasses the most victory points through enclosing space with fences and acquiring the largest number and variety of animals and victory point-generating buildings will be the winner. \r\n Four Standard Buildings and 4 special buildings are available in the base game. These buildings each provide unique special abilities during play and/or VP at game end. Balancing the tension between building infrastructure (fenced pastures and buildings) and acquiring animals (the single biggest source of end-game scoring) is the key to success! \r\n  Contents:  1 game board, 2 farm boards, 144 wooden pieces, 16 cardboard tiles, 4 farm extensions, 1 starting player tile, 9 goods tiles, 1 score pad, and 1 rule sheet.

To win, you must acquire all the trappings of great wealth, avoid as many pitfalls as you can and still walk away with a huge pile of cash at the end of it all. This Reiner Knizia classic makes a great travel game and an easy one to introduce to friends and family.  Originally published in 1995, High Society gained sufficient popularity to see it through 3 re-prints but none of them as beautiful as the latest FRED Edition. Artist Paul Niemeyer has done an outstanding job creating a theme to reflect the most elite fineries of the Gilded Age, combined with FREDs commitment to quality components and card stocks, this edition of High Society will stand as the pinnacle of its production.  For 3-5 players over 10 years old, this 30-45 minute game can be played as a light filler between longer games, but to be honest with you, this one is very hard to put back in the box! The cards tells an exciting story and feature beautiful artwork from well-known Eagle Games artist Paul Niemeyer.  Game Summary: Players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth, namely the ten luxury possession (positive-number) and three 2X multiplier cards; while avoiding its pitfalls represented by three cards altogether, including the gambling (-5) card; the thief (lose a possession) card; and the calamitous fire (lose one half the value of all your possession cards) card. While bidding, though, players must keep an eye on their remaining cash. At the end of the game, even though all those positive-number cards might add up to a win, the player with the least money is not even considered for victory. ",

      ' "What this town needs is a pet store." No one knows which imp said it, but every imp recognized the idea was pure genius: "A pet shop for dungeon lords? What a great idea! Yeah, and no one else is doing it! No competition! We\'ll be rich!"  And now you have just opened the first pet shop in town. Right next door to the other first pet shop in town. Across the street from two more.  Buy baby monsters! Feed them and watch them grow! Clean their cages!  Yes, running a pet store is exciting for an imp. But it can also be mentally challenging: What is the smartest way to win the upcoming exhibition? Which pet is best suited for your dungeon lord customer? How strong a cage do you need, and if you guess wrong, how many family members will be maimed?  Win or lose, you are sure to enjoy the grand opening of Dungeon Petz. \r\n   \r\n \r\n \r\n Become the leader of an imp family that has just started a new business – breeding and selling petz. Sound simple and safe? Well, we forgot to mention that those petz are for Dungeon Lords. This means magical, playful, sometimes angry monsters that constantly desire attention and at the very moment you want them to demonstrate their qualities to buyers they are sick or they poop. Sometimes you are even glad that you got rid of them – but the profit is unbelievable. \r\n   Dungeon Petz   is a standalone game set in the  Dungeon Lords  universe. The game consists of several rounds in which players use unusual worker placement mechanisms (players simultaneously prepare different sized groups of imps in order to play sooner than others) to prepare themselves for the uneasy task of raising creature cubs and pleasing their different needs (represented by cards) in order to sell them as grown and scary creatures to Dungeon Lords. In the meantime, they also attend various contests in which they show off their pets, scoring additional points. \r\n \r\n ',

      "  Pandemic: The Cure  a dice-based version of the popular Pandemic board game, sets up in less than a minute and plays in 30 minutes. \r\n As in the board game, four diseases threaten the world and it's up to your team to save humanity. You and your team must keep the world's hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.  \r\n Players roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. \r\n Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities - and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. \r\n Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.  \r\n At the end of each turn, new \"infection dice\" are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose. If, however, the players can discover the cures to the four diseases, they all win and humanity is saved!. ",

      " The city of Magoria has not always been a place of magic and mystery. Decades ago, it was just another ordinary trade center loaded with shameless courtesans and greedy merchants longing for more and more wealth and prosperity.  But, as we have already learned from history, a single man's will, if strong enough can change the world. It wasn't different with Magoria either; it only took one person, with immense talent and ambition, to change things forever.  A talented young boy inspired by the enigmatic world of illusion tried his luck on the street with his revolutionary acts of magic. It didn't take long for people to take notice, and within weeks, he was already considered to be a genius by the public. The acts of even the greatest illusionists of the time seemed shallow and mediocre compared to his talent. In less than a year, the youngster became one of the greatest magicians of his time, a true legend of illusion who became known as Dahlgaard the Magnificent.  Trickerion - Legends of Illusion is a competitive Euro-style strategy game set in a fictional city inspired by the late 19th century urban life and culture, where players take on the role of rival stage illusionists.  Players strive to become the city's greatest Magician by acquiring the most Fame points. But there is much more at stake than prestige alone. The audience's favourite wins the contest for the mighty Trickerion Stone, a relic that grants supernatural powers to its owner, making him a true Legend of Illusion. ",

After each harvest, the farmers assemble at the gates of Loyang to sell and trade their vegetables. They deliver to their regular customers or lucratively sell their vegetables to passing shoppers. Vegetables can also be traded at Market stalls or used for seed and planted in fields. If the farmers need vegetables that they don't have in stock, they can buy them in the Shop. Twenty different helpers, each with different individual skills, are available to assist them. The most successful farmer will be the one who moves furthest along the Path of Prosperity within the given time frame. Each step costs more and more money, which is also needed for investments.

Each card will give you two pieces of coral to place anywhere on your board (as long as a stack of coral won't be higher than four pieces) before checking a scoring condition on the bottom part of the card.

The arcane powers of the Necromancers have unleashed a zombie invasion in the age of swords and sorcery, and it's up to your group of straggling survivors to not only stay alive during these dark times, but to take back the realm and punish those responsible for the apocalypse! \r\n  Zombicide: Black Plague  allows you take control of paladins, dwarves, knights, and magicians, wielding powerful swords, crossbows, and even magic spells to defeat the zombie hordes and its Necromancer overlords. The classic  Zombicide  rules have been revamped for this new incarnation of the game, while still retaining the nonstop action, tense atmosphere and easy-to-learn rules that made  Zombicide  a classic. Equip your survivor with equipment like chainmail armor or shields to defend against the undead, pick up spell books to perform fantastic enchantments, or light up a pool of dragon bile to create an all-consuming inferno of dragon fire! \r\n Take on the zombie invasion from the medieval streets to secret vaults that create quick passages through the citadel (and often hold special artifacts). Chase down the elusive Necromancers to keep them from multiplying the zombie masses. And tackle a whole new set of missions through which your group of survivors will become the heroes of the land (or the last victims of the zombie massacre). ",

During the course of the game, the players develop their farms and deliver goods to the village as they vie to earn the title of La Granja for their country estate. Speed and timing is critical!  La Granja is a fascinating game that requires careful planning. Successful players must learn to cope with the vagaries of the dice and cards. The player who has earned the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner and new owner of the La Granja estate!  Over the course of 6 game rounds, players will expand their farm by adding fields, farm extensions, market barrows, and helpers. They will earn VPs by delivering goods to the village of Esporles. Players have two options to early VPs in the village:  1. When a player has fully supplied a craft building, he received VPs and a craft market which grants a bonus for the remainder of the game.  2. When a player has fully supplied a market barrow on his farm, he sets up a market stall in the marketplace and receives VPs and a trade commodity.  It is important to observe the actions of other players, to manipulate turn order, and to adjust for the dice and the cards during the course of the game. ",

You'll go for the dice again and again only to risk losing it all on a single roll. Players try to win three of the eleven number columns as quickly as possible. To do this, they roll the four dice and form two pairs, which determine the columns on which they may first place the white cones (the runners). During their turn, players may roll the dice as long as they wish -provided that they can place or move at least one of the runners. If, after rolling the dice, a player is unable to do so, his turn ends immediately and he loses everything that he achieved during that turn. He should have stopped in time... but he didn't!

The pillbug moves like the queen bee—one space at a time—but it also has a special ability that it may use instead of moving. This ability allows the pillbug to move an adjacent unstacked piece (whether friendly or enemy) two spaces: up onto the pillbug itself, then down into another empty space adjacent to itself. Some exceptions for this ability: \r\n \r\n The Pillbug may not move the piece most recently moved by the opponent. \r\n The Pillbug may not move any piece in a stack of pieces. \r\n The Pillbug may not move a piece if it splits the hive (violating the One Hive Rule). \r\n The Pillbug may not move a piece through a too-narrow gap of stacked pieces (violating the Freedom to Move Rule). \r\n Any piece moved by the Pillbug may not be moved at all (directly or via the Pillbug action) on the next player's turn. \r\n \r\n The mosquito can mimic either the movement or special ability of the Pillbug, even when the Pillbug it is touching has been rendered immobile by another pillbug. \r\n \r\n \r\n  Contents:  2 Pillbug Tiles ",

Builders compete against each other to contribute the most to this cathedral's construction and, in so doing, score the most victory points. To play the game, players must use workers to procure raw building materials, and then use craftsmen to refine the materials into victory points.  What actions will you take on your path to victory? Will you seek an audience with the king perhaps, to get to the metal you need? Or should you avail yourself of the support of influential personalities? A brief stay in the monastery could be as beneficial to you as strong ties to your craftsmen. Your workers may also be used to produce gold, the currency of the game.  Players are given three master builders each turn, each of which can do a variety of tasks, including recruiting more workers, buying or selling goods, or directly obtaining victory points. Getting early choices with a master builder costs gold, as does purchasing more capable craftsmen. Players must strike a balance between earning gold to fund their purchases and earning victory points.

The Psychic must then provide a clue that is *conceptually* where the bullseye is located between those two binaries. \r\n For example, if the card this round is HOT-COLD and the bullseye is slightly to the "cold" side of the centre, the Psychic needs to give a clue somewhere in that region.

A wooden marker moves along the board's legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement of the story's plot.

Broom Service is a simultaneous-selection (but then sequential play) card game. Players select 5 of their 12 role cards to play per set, then they reveal them in sequence. Each role has a main full action and a less valuable \"favor\" action. If you are the first player with that role you announce that you are that character. If you follow after but choose that same role card you can take the favor action instead, or declare that you are that character in hopes that you can command the full action. You risk having it taken from you by a later player, though. The different roles help players collect different ingredients and money to make potions listed on the cauldron cards. When everyone's five role cards have been played and actions taken, another five cards are chosen for the next set and the process repeats as before.  Broom Service is a revised and expanded version of Witch's Brew.   Includes: -Tiles - 32 clouds, 24 magic wands, 15 amulets, and 17 landscape tiles -Wooden pieces - 60 potion bottles, 10 pawns, 5 victory point markers -Cards - 50 (5 x 10) roles cards, 10 events cards -Instructions - 2 game summaries + a 12-page rules booklet -Double-sided game board - For basic and advanced play ",

      " China, 1570. China is under the reign of the Longqing Emperor, of the Ming Dynasty. The Emperor has inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. Realising the depth of chaos his father’s long reign had caused, the Longqing Emperor set about reforming the government by re-employing talented officials previously banished by his father. The Emperor resides in the Forbidden city, which was the seat of many emperors under the Ming Dynasty. The Forbidden City is currently known as “Gùgõng” (Imperial Palace) by the people of China. Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres). It is also under the Ming Dynasty that the Great Wall of China was rebuilt, fortified and expanded. During this period, China was under heavy attack the Mongols, so maintaining the Great Wall was essential. Most of what we now have left of Great Wall, we owe to the Ming dynasty. \r\n The country was already famous for its very intricate bureaucracy, but this also led to a lot of corruption. However, the Longqing Emperor tried to eradicate corruption as much as he could, by simply having it officially prohibited, and punishable by death. \r\n This measure seemed successful at first, but as we all know, it is not so simple to keep perfect control over one’s “loyal” subjects. At the imperial court, the highest officials would pretend to uphold the ban on corruption, and instead of simply accepting money, a new custom saw the light of day: the exchange of gifts. \r\n If a petitioner visited an official to present a request, they would also present a gift. And naturally, the official would return the honour by presenting a gift in return. If the gift of the petitioner was something quite valuable, like, say, a Jade statue, and the return gift from the official was a cheap paper fan, it was hard to regard this as an act of bribery. However, both knew very well how valuable the symbolism of said item could be… \r\n “Gùgõng” uses this extraordinary custom as its basis. The players take on the role of powerful Chinese families trying to gain influence and power by bribing certain officials responsible for certain tasks, by offering suitable gifts. \r\n A player wins by gaining an audience with the emperor. If several players succeed to do this, the player with the most VPs amongst those players wins the game. ",

      " Four years in the making,   Oceans   is the next stand-alone game in the award-winning Evolution series. \r\n  Theme  Enter a vast, underwater cosmos: a mysterious interconnected world of sharp teeth, glowing eyes, and black ink, where your survival depends on your ability to adapt to the unknown. The foundation of the oceanic food chain are billions of one-celled organisms called phytoplankton that capture the sun's energy through photosynthesis. The next level are species that feast on the sea's abundant plant life — zooplankton. All of this takes place in Catherine Hamilton's beautifully illustrated central board called the Reef. Every other oceanic species is a predator, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded apex predator. And even bigger than apex predators are enormous filter feeders that gently swim through the ocean scooping up everything in their path with their baleen. \r\n  Gameplay  Oceans is a continuation of North Star's quest to make a gamers' game that is easy to teach. Game designers Nick Bentley and Dominic Crapuchettes don't think people need to sit through 30+ minutes of rules explanations to get an immersive experience. \r\n The foundation of Oceans is a simple turn structure and a deck of 10 straightforward traits, making it easy to learn all of the cards and wade effortlessly into the first game. The 10 traits were chosen because of the rich thematic interconnections, providing a tapestry of synergistic card play. Additionally, there are 4 randomly chosen scenario cards that activate (and sometimes deactivate) at various points during the game. The scenario cards impact the basic tenets of gameplay, encouraging people to vary their play style and strategy each game. \r\n This foundation loosely mimics a scientific oceanic ecosystem, similar to what you've come to expect from games in the Evolution series. This is the core of Oceans and it's fully playable on its own. But there's more if you are willing to dive a bit deeper... \r\n Oceans also includes something which will break the seams of the scientific reality you've come to accept: The Deep. The Deep is a deck of 100 unique power cards that require an additional cost to play. These power cards range from things you might find in nature to the fantastical Kraken or Leviathan. \r\n Oceans is an engine builder where the world of science is disrupted at the seams by the world of fantasy. Players must adapt to the changing environment with an interconnected ecosystem that can survive and thrive against the inevitable march of time and the natural struggle of predators seeking to survive.

      " A world of peace has been torn asunder by the opening of a vile portal from the goblin kingdom. Nasty goblins now pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving, and sacred, mushroom folk - and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...  In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure nostalgic of old Nintendo games like The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins.   Each round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.  Heroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat, and by gryphon to get to all the places they need to go to satisfy their quests - or to position themselves for what night brings. Each type of movement is different, and limited, players need to take careful consideration when traveling, and how they travel, if they wish to accomplish all of their goals.  During the night, players must face the challenges of their quests, and decisions, by rolling dice, hoping for fortune, and knowing when to quit. Will you press on? Or is it time to save your progress and rest? Tomorrow is another day.  The game ends once the portal is closed or all the goblins have been eradicated. The player who has acquired the most victory points by slaying goblins, learning spells, and completing quests is crowned the winner! ",

      " Think outside the square! Ingenious is an abstract tile-placement game in which the players take turns placing tiles in the shape of two connected hexagons into a hexagonal grid on the board. Each tile has two colored symbols on it. Players earn points in a specific color for each line of matching colored symbols that they extend when they place a tile. A player's final score is determined by his or her lowest scoring color, not the highest. The winner is the player whose lowest score is the highest compared to the other players' lowest scores, and not the player with the highest scoring color overall.  The game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two hexagons connected along one side. Each hexagon has one of six colored symbols in it, with most tiles having two different colored symbols and some having two of the same colored symbol. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it. During his or her turn, each player places one tile from his or her rack onto two empty hexagonal spaces on the game board. For each of the two hexagons composing this tile, the player scores one point in the hexagon's color for each already-placed hexagon of the same color that radiates outward in a straight line from one of the placed hexagon's five sides. If a player's score in a color reaches 18, he or she immediately takes another turn. At the end of the turn, the player refills his or her rack to six tiles.  When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.  Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play. This highly awarded, international bestseller has been redesigned with a plastic board. ",

    description:
      " In Victorian England, the profits of the Industrial Revolution have given rise to a wealthy upper class of English ladies and gentlemen. Sadly, you are not among them. But you do have a rich uncle, recently departed, who decided on his death bed to leave all his money to the relative who will enjoy it the most. To find out who that is, you and your cousins will each be given a substantial sum of money. Whoever can spend it the fastest will inherit all your uncle's wealth.  Last Will is a race to bankruptcy. In each round, you choose a plan for the day, which determines how many options you will have available and how much time you will have for them. If you don't give yourself enough options, you might find yourself with nothing left to do after attending the theatre. If you don't set aside enough time, you might have to forgo dinner prepared by London's most famous chef or a carriage ride with a charming guest. And don't neglect your property investments. Or rather, do neglect them: Once your properties depreciate, you can sell them for a pittance, bringing you that much closer to bankruptcy. The upper class lifestyle provides you many opportunities to spend your uncle's money. Just be sure to spend it fast.  A luxurious life of fabulous wealth is within your grasp. With your uncle's Last Will, bankruptcy leads to riches! \r\n In   Last Will  , each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players. \r\n Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being: \r\n \r\n Take a card on display and add it to your hand. \r\n Draw a card from any regular deck – This can be chosen only once by each player. \r\n Visit the opera and spend $2. \r\n Adjust the value modifiers in the property market. \r\n Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards. \r\n \r\n Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses – of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! – to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy. \r\n At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market. \r\n If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins. ",

      " Stockpile is an economic board game that combines the traditional stockholding strategy of buy low, sell high with several additional mechanisms to create a fast-paced, engaging and interactive experience. In Stockpile, players act as stock market investors at the end of the 20th century hoping to strike it rich, and the investor with the most money at the end of the game is the winner. Stockpile centers around the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile. First, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock's value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time. Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line. Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your ",

Mr. Jack is very clever, though: he is pretending to be one of them ...  \r\n   Mr. Jack   is an asymetric game for two players. Each player has a different aim. One takes on the role of the Detective, the other Mr. Jack. The Detective must unmask Mr. Jack's cover and then catch him. Mr. Jack will try to use the cover of darkness to slip away while doing his best to slow down the investigation. Using successive deductions, by moving characters in and out of the darkness, the Detective will reduce the number of suspects and tighten the noose around Mr. Jack. Will he capture Mr. Jack before the end of the eighth turn? \r\n During each turn, the players move the characters, using their special powers and placing them either in shadow or light. At the end of each turn, the witnesses declare whether Jack is visible — that is, in light or adjacent to another character — or not (alone in the shadows). This allows the investigator to know which characters are innocent. As the turns progress, the investigator tries to eliminate suspects while Jack tries to escape. Intuition, logic, and cold blood will be necessary for each of the two participants. \r\n  Mr. Jack  is a tense game of light and darkness. A best seller, it can be played by all.

      " In the dystopic 1930s, the industrial revolution pushed to the limit the exploitation of fossil-based resources, and now only powerful and unlimited hydroelectric energy is available to fulfill the thirst for power of the massive machines and unstoppable engineering progress. \r\n   Barrage   is a resource management and strategic placement game in which players compete to build their majestic dams, raise them to increase their storing capacity of precious water, and deliver all the potential power through pressure tunnels connected to powerhouse energy turbines. Each player represents one of the international companies who are gathering machineries, innovative patents, and brilliant engineers to claim the best locations to capture and exploit the water power of a contested Alpine region crossed by rivers. \r\n  Barrage  includes two innovative and challenging mechanisms. First, the construction wheel has to be managed by players to carefully plan their actions and handle their machineries since both your action tokens and resources are stored on the wheel and come back only after a full wheel round is completed. The more you construct and perform maintenance on your wheel, the earlier that resources and actions return to you. \r\n Second, the water flow on the rivers depicted on the board is a shared and contested resource. Players have to intercept and store as much of the water as they can, build dams (upstream dams are expensive but can block part of the water before it reaches dams downstream), raise their dams to increase capacity, and build long tunnels to divert water to their powerhouses. Water is never consumed — its flow is just used to produce energy — and released in the rivers, so you have to strategically place your dams to recover water diverted by you and other players. \r\n Over five rounds, players must fulfill power requirements represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal contracts. At the same time, by placing a limited number of engineers, they attempt to increase their machineries to acquire new and more efficient construction actions and to build and activate special unique effect buildings to customize their own developing strategy.

Jamey read over the rules and was impressed both by what the airships added to the game and by the effort Kai had put into the expansion through writing the rules and playtesting it. So Kai, Jakub, and Jamey collaborated to hone the airship module.  In the airship module, 2 airship tiles are randomly paired at the beginning of the game (1 passive and 2 aggressive; there are 16 total tiles). Each player's airship miniature (a new type of unit; 1 big miniature for each of the 7 factions [the sculpts are identical, and the bases are different colors to match the factions]) has those abilities, as well as the core ability that airships are free to move onto any territory (land or water) and across rivers. Each player starts with their airship on their home base, so they can start moving out of their home area right away. The airship miniatures measure 104x34x42mm, and they have clear, plastic, removable stands/bases.  In the resolution module, resolution tiles add a twist to the way each game ends. There are 8 of them, and 1 will be used each game. They often have an impact in the decisions you’ll make throughout the game. ",

The goal is to build a working infrastructure and manufacture prestigious items - such as books, ceramics, ornaments and relics - to gain the most victory points at the end of the game. \r\n Each player has a landscape with a Clay Mound, a Cloister Office, and a Farmyard, He receives livestock, grains, coins, or clay when he places his clergymen onto these buildings. How many goods he receives depends on the position of the goods indicator on the production wheel. Whenever a goods type is taken, the corresponding goods indicator is moved back to 0. Each time the production wheel is rotated at the start of a round, all production is increased.  There are two other goods at the start of the game: wood and peat. These can only be obtained when a forest or moor card is removed from a player's landscape. Players can buy additional landscapes to add to their starting landscape. These landscapes can provide room to build buildings with building materials as well as settlements with food and energy. Some of the buildings are special cloister buildings. Since these must always be built adjacent to other cloister buildings, a cloister of ever-increasing size develops that the player can be rewarded for with the House of Brotherhood.  The settlements are of special interest in the game. They must be cleverly built next to other buildings and settlements so that they are worth as many points as possible at the end of the game.

      " At the turn of the 16th Century, King Manuel I commissioned Portugal's greatest artisans to construct grandiose buildings. After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans — whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began. \r\n In   Azul: Summer Pavilion  , players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family. \r\n  Azul: Summer Pavilion  lasts six rounds, and in each round players draft tiles, then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds. \r\n At the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory, you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively, you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile, if present. \r\n After all tiles have been claimed, players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6, and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5, for example, you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required), placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile. \r\n If you complete surround a pillar, statue, or window on your game board with tiles, you get an immediate bonus, taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board. At the end of the round, you can carry over at most four tiles to the next round; discard any others, losing 1 point for each such tile. \r\n After six rounds, you score a bonus for each of the seven stars that you've filled completely. Additionally, you score a bonus for having covered all seven spaces of value 1, 2, 3 or 4. You lose 1 point for each remaining tile unused, then whoever has the most points wins. \r\n  —description from the publisher  ",

This discovery also led to further exploration, competition....and later, war! During this time of prosperity and opportunity, you find yourself traveling on the high seas in search of these exotic wonders. As a merchant and privateer representing your nation, you seek to control this region for glory and profit. Your journey continues in the Far East... \r\n Designed by Emerson Matsuuchi,   Century: Eastern Wonders   invites fans to return to the exciting world of spice trading as players take to the high seas in the role of merchants seeking to prosper in the exotic Indonesian islands.  Century: Eastern Wonders  offers new, satisfying game mechanisms that provide infinite replayability and countless strategies. \r\n  Century: Eastern Wonders  can be combined with  Century: Spice Road  to create a new gaming experience called  Sand To Sea !

      " The City Council recently approved the zoning map for a new urban development - The Estates - featuring high-end infrastructure and a modern atmosphere for its citizens. Soon after, the banks awarded millions of dollars in loans to six real estate investment firms to help develop this new area. The zoning map for The Estates calls for two rows of four buildings each, located between the River and Main Street. The meadows on the other side of the River are to remain a recreational area for the City.  But, with hopes of larger profits, investors and building tycoons entirely ignore the City Council's demands and begin developing three rows of buildings instead. The Mayor catches wind of the potential for profit and begins planning a new mansion in The Estates, which would double the value of one of the building rows! With some sketchy Building Permits, investors begin developing buildings on the other side of the River, beyond the designated building zone.  However, the City Council takes rigorous steps to put an end to the racketeering with an ultimatum: as soon as the first two rows are completed, the buildings in the uncompleted row will be torn down, resulting in a huge loss for all who invested there. At the end of the day, the investor with the highest-valued buildings will come out on top!

On each turn you select two tiles from your hand, reveal them, then work with your partners to place them.  At the end of the game, each castle is scored. Your personal final score is the lower of the scores of the two castles you helped design, and the player with the highest final score wins the game.

      " In  Thurn & Taxis , players build post office routes across Bavaria and the regions around, collecting bonus points in various ways. The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center. \r\n Players build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities. Each route must consist of at least three cities. Players may only build one route at a time. Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route. \r\n Players start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card and a player aid card. The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards. On a turn a player will draw a card from a display of six, face up, city cards (or the top of the face down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one. If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it. The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage. Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of: drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route. Once a route is scored the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on his next turn. \r\n When a player exhausts his supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage the end of the game is triggered. Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes his turn, and the game ends. Players score points for their highest valued carriage and bonus tiles, and lose points for unplaced post offices. The player with the most points wins. \r\n The fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element. ",

For example, Padmé Amidala might fight alongside Rey and Finn, taking on Jabba the Hutt, Kylo Ren, and Jango Fett. \r\n Each round, you use your characters' abilities, an assortment of dice, and a carefully constructed thirty-card deck filled with events, upgrades, and supports. You and your opponent alternate actions: activating your dice, playing cards from your hand, attacking your foes, and claiming the battlefield.

Everyone will try to draw what the game master wrote on the prompt cards, but each player is only allowed to draw one line. For example, if the topic is \"cat\", you could draw an ear or a whisker so that the other players know you know the topic. There is one fake artist among the players - someone who doesn't know the topic and will have to draw a line randomly.  After each player has drawn twice, they will have to decide who the fake artist is. If the fake artist receives the most votes, that player loses. Otherwise, the fake artist and the game master win the game. Now, you might think it is extremely easy to find out who the fake artist is, but there is one more rule: Even if the fake artist receives the most votes, that player can still guess the topic of the picture everyone drew - and win with a correct guess!  Knowing this rule, it becomes much more difficult for the real artists to draw their lines. You want to show the other artists that you know the topic of the picture, but you don't want to be too obvious in front of the fake artist - so the picture becomes a crazy mess!

      " The classic detective game! In  Clue , players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where? Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations. Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out. ",

Join Frodo and the Fellowship on the perilous adventure across Middle Earth, and use your skill and fortune to guide you!   Created by master designer Reiner Knizia,  The Lord of the Rings  is fully illustrated by celebrated Tolkien artist John Howe. Help guide the Fellowship past Sauron's wickedness and save Middle Earth from darkness! Players take on the role of five Hobbits-Merry, Pippen, Fatty, Sam, and Frodo-on their quest to destroy the One Ring. They must work their way through four boards, cooperating to overcome challenges and prevent the Ringbearer from being corrupted.  The Lord of the Rings board game is a unique and original game in which players must work together to defeat the game itself, a daunting task that will challenge even the most experienced players. The cooperative play style immerses players into the game, cheering their success and cursing the foul turns of fate that hinder their quest.  The Silver Line Edition of The Lord of the Rings was given a graphics overhaul, retaining the elegant illustrations of John Howe while updating the game boards and components. Because many of the components have changed in size and design (making the game much more compact)  the Silver Line edition is incompatible with previously released expansions.  ",

      "  Sidereal Confluence: Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian Quadrant  is a unique trading and negotiation game. \r\n Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resources necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a uniquely cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.  Each player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of resources to use, resulting in an output of more resources, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, VP and all kinds of resources.   Each game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for resources, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race's special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Convocation follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.  The ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.  The game is almost all simultaneous play, keeping the game play moving. \r\n  Contents:  \r\n \r\n 390 Cards \r\n 292 Wood pieces \r\n Dozens of tokens \r\n 9 Player sheets detailing tips and advice on how to play a race \r\n Rulebook \r\n ",

      " \r\n \r\n   Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 4 - Nederland   contains a new game board with new rules for use with  Ticket to Ride  or  Ticket to Ride: Europe  with players now creating train lines in the Netherlands. \r\n The basics of  TtR  gameplay remain the same as always — players collect train cards in order to claim routes between pairs of cities with the overall goal of completing tickets they hold in hand — but  Ticket to Ride: Nederland  twists this gameplay in two ways. First, nearly every route on the game board is a double-route, with two tracks connecting cities. Both of these routes are in play no matter how many players are in the game. \r\n Second, every route — whether double or single — has a bridge toll that a player must pay when building on that route. On a single route or the first track of a double route, the player pays this toll — which costs 1-4 coins — to the bank; on the second track of a double route, the player pays this toll to the player who built the first track. Players start the game with 30 coins, and if you can't pay a toll, you must take a loan card to cover the fare, with each loan costing you 5 points at the end of the game. \r\n In addition to helping you avoid loans, coins matter because at game's end, players receive a bonus based on how many coins they hold relative to everyone else. In a five-player game, for example, the player with the most coins scores a 55 point bonus; the 2nd place player scores 35 points, and the other players 20, 10 and 0 points. If you've taken a loan, however, you're ineligible for this bonus scoring, so players have an incentive to build early and often. \r\n These coin bonuses are balanced by the multitude of destination tickets with large point values: six of them are worth 29+ points while another seventeen are worth 17-26 points. \r\n \r\n ",

In Railroad Ink, players roll the Route dice and must then draw the subsequent results on their individual Route boards. Players score points for having long interconnected Routes, as well as connecting the entry points to their board, plus having Routes through the center of their boards. But beware, they'll lose points for leaving unfinished lines. It's a challenge to keep their roads and rails from getting destroyed, and having to repair them when they are.

Unite to survive by hunting monsters and collectively guiding the development of your settlement through a 30 year, self-running campaign. \r\n   \r\n Every decision matters.

Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail. \r\n   \r\n  Gear System  \r\n In Monster, survivors will craft gear using resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a gear grid, and can slot up to 9 pieces of gear at a time. What gear you will carry and how you arrange it can unlock advantages that may make the difference between life and death. \r\n   \r\n  Story Event System  \r\n You will encounter 40+ story events that will shape the story of your unique campaign. Your settlement\'s decisions and discoveries affect how the story events unfold.

In the height of its power Portugal controlled the sea trade from Brazil to Japan and attained overwhelming wealth with the trade monopoly on spices.  The players represent wealthy trade dynasties that help to build up the Portuguese colonial empire.

Competing for new discoveries, colonies, shipyards, and churches it is very important to observe the actions of the other players.  Navigator is a challenging strategy game with a little luck, because no-one knows exactly what to expect when discovering new sea regions.

Morels may be the most sought-after in these woods, but there are many tasty and valuable varieties awaiting the savvy collector. Bring a basket if you think it's your lucky day. Forage at night and you will be all alone when you stumble upon a bonanza. If you're hungry, put a pan on the fire and bask in the aroma of chanterelles as you saute them in butter. Feeling mercantile? Sell porcini to local aficionados for information that will help you find what you seek deep in the forest. \r\n   Morels  , a strategic card game for two players, uses two decks: a Day Deck (84 cards) that includes ten different types of mushrooms as well as baskets, cider, butter, pans, and moons; and a smaller Night Deck (8 cards) of mushrooms to be foraged by moonlight. Each mushroom card has two values: one for selling and one for cooking. Selling two or more like mushrooms grants foraging sticks that expand your options in the forest (that is, the running tableau of eight face-up cards on the table), enabling offensive or defensive plays that change with every game played. Cooking sets of three or more like mushrooms – sizzling in butter or cider if the set is large enough – earns points toward winning the game. With poisonous mushrooms wielding their wrath and a hand-size limit to manage, card selection is a tricky proposition at every turn. \r\n Following each turn, one card from the forest moves into a decay pile that is available for only a short time. The Day Deck then refills the forest from the back, creating the effect of a walk in the woods in which some strategic morsels are collected, some are passed by, and others lay ahead.

      " The shifting Warp Storms that surround the lost Herakon Cluster have finally abated, leaving ancient treasures and planets open to the rest of the galaxy. Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination is beyond calculation, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.    Forbidden Stars  challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same - to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You'll need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you. \r\n Each round in  Forbidden Stars  is divided into three phases. In the planning phase, players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to: \r\n \r\n  Dominate , draining friendly planets of their important resources \r\n  Strategize , purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities \r\n  Deploy , building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units \r\n  Advance , moving units and attacking their enemies. \r\n \r\n The last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle. \r\n Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in  Forbidden Stars  is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game's set-up also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that players must work to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.

      "  Steam  places you in control of a railway company, with goods to deliver and track to be built. Opportunities abound, but your opponents can also take advantage of goods, demands, and the terrain to challenge you. Spend your money carefully, create a network of tracks to connect cities, and deliver goods to become the greatest railroad of them all! \r\n In  Steam , you build railroads and deliver goods along an ever-changing network of tracks and stations. You build the tracks, upgrade towns, improve your train, and grab the right goods to make the longest, most profitable deliveries. Score your deliveries and add to your income or victory points, balancing your need to invest against your quest to win the game. Steam contains a beautiful, double-sided game board. The map on each side depicts terrain, towns, and cities at the start of the railway age. \r\n The map of the northeastern USA and neighboring Canada is ideal for 3 or 4 players. Use the map of Europe's lower Rhine and Ruhr region when playing a 4- or 5-player game. And, because you can play Steam on any number of current and future variant and expansion maps, we include pieces for 6 players.  \r\n Steam contains: A full-color, double-sided game board, 136 double-sided track tiles, 8 New City tiles, 7 double-sided Action tiles, 144 wooden player tokens (in 6 colors), 96 wooden goods cubes (in 5 colors), 9 City Growth markers, 67 gold, silver and copper money tokens, 1 wooden train turn marker, 1 cloth goods bag, A simple, full color rules booklet for both the Base and Standard games ",
